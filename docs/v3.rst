Major changes in v3.0.0
=======================

The following major changes occurred in pickley v3.0.0, please report_ any issue you find:

- NOT using pex_ any more (unfortunately there's always an issue with dependencies when using pex_,
  like for example: click_ having different requirements depending on python version)

- New bootstrap script get-pickley_

- pickley_ does not try and "bootstrap itself" anymore (used to re-install itself as a venv, from pex_)
