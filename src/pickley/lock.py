    Simple soft file lock mechanism

    Several pickley processes could be attempting to auto upgrade a package at the same time

    - lock consists of creating a <folder>.lock file, pid of process that created the file is stored there
    - a timeout of > 0 can be used to wait for lock acquisition
    - a timeut of 0 will make it so that calling process fails to obtain lock immediately (via SoftLockException)
    - a lock can be held only for the given 'invalid' time (allows to not get blocked by a crashed left-over)
    - the created folder is kept around for 'keep' days (if > 0)
